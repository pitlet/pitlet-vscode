# Vue Example

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/pitlet/pitlet-vscode.git &&
cd pitlet-vscode/packages/extension/examples/vue &&
npm install &&
code .
```

Make sure that you have installed the pitlet extension for VSCode.

If everything works, the dev server should start automatically on `http://localhost:3000` and you should be able to update `src/App.vue` in VSCode and see the updates as you type.


<!-- TODO make it easier to get started by not requiring knowledge of git clone, npm install etc.

it also works when requiring ../web_modules/vue.js, basically vanilla without npm
 -->
