# React Example

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/pitlet/pitlet-vscode.git &&
cd pitlet-vscode/packages/extension/examples/react &&
npm install &&
code .
```

Make sure that you have installed the pitlet extension for VSCode.

If everything works, the dev server should start automatically on `http://localhost:3000` and you should be able to update `src/App.js` in VSCode and see the updates as you type.
